## 🎯 About Me

I'm a passionate self-taught cybersecurity researcher focused on **red team operations** and **reconnaissance frameworks**. I believe in learning through building - every line of code teaches something new about offensive security.

```python
class ShadowCrawlerX:
    def __init__(self):
        self.role = "Red Team Developer"
        self.code = ["Python", "Bash", "PowerShell"]
        self.focus = ["Reconnaissance", "OSINT", "Enumeration"]
        self.learning = "Always"
        self.collaboration = "Open"
```
